## TONY'S STORY (Use for personal posts)

Over 30 years ago, I lost my daughter.

I fell into deep depression. My health crashed. I withdrew from the world for years. The only emotion I really felt was anger — otherwise I felt like a zombie. Almost nothing.

Then a friend offered me a Reiki session. Normally I would have laughed at it. But I felt so dead inside, I thought I'd try anything.

It changed everything.

I felt energy moving in my body for the first time in years. When I left, the world looked different — the leaves in the trees seemed clearer, almost moving in slow motion. Something had shifted.

That led me to train in Reiki (all the way to Master), then Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture. It was during my TCM studies that I finally understood how our bodies hold emotions — and that's when I was able to release the sadness and anger I'd been carrying since losing my daughter.

My real healing started there.

I studied under a Medical Qigong Master named Robert for years before his passing. He taught me routines I still use today. He saw something in me and bestowed the title of Medical Qigong Master.

Before he died, Robert told me he saw me becoming the first Daoist Priest in Canada. I didn't even know what that was at the time.

But his words stayed with me. Eventually I found a Daoist Abbot who agreed to train me. I studied with him for years until his passing. He was the most amazing person I've ever met — he could see right through me. He didn't tell people what they wanted to hear. He told them what they needed to hear.

Not long before he passed, my Shifu ordained me as a Daoist Priest and gave me the name Li Heping. It's one of the things that has meant the most to me in my life.

Today I've done over 2,000 energy sessions. I have 170+ five-star reviews. I've trained many Reiki Masters, some who went on to start their own practices. I've coached people around the world on how to calm their mind.

And I wrote a book: "Feel Fully Alive Again: How To Calm Your Mind, Heal Yourself & Take Back Your Inner Power."

But none of that matters as much as this: I went from feeling like a zombie to feeling fully alive again. And now I help others do the same.

## CORE CONCEPTS (Use for educational posts)

### DRAINED VS STAGNATED

**If you're DRAINED:**
- Your system is low on reserves
- You've been running on willpower for a long time
- Your body isn't asking for more effort — it's asking for support
- This often happens after long-term stress, caregiving, health challenges, or emotional load
- You may still function... but underneath, your energy is thin
- Rest helps, but you never feel fully restored

What helps: Gentle practices, consistency over intensity, feeling safe, being supported not pushed
What doesn't help: Forcing yourself, high-intensity routines, "powering through"

**If you're STAGNATED:**
- You have energy — it's just stuck
- Your system isn't empty, it's blocked
- You feel tense, restless, wired, or frustrated
- Rest doesn't always help — sometimes it makes things worse
- Your energy wants to move, not collapse

What helps: Flow and circulation, releasing tension, expressing what's held in, guided movement
What doesn't help: Over-resting, suppressing emotions, staying in your head

### THE FOUR EMOTIONAL PATTERNS

**Anger / Frustration (Liver energy)**
You're holding back expression. You need safe release and forward movement — not suppression.
Focus: Flow, breath, expression.

**Sadness / Grief (Lung energy)**
Something in you is asking to be acknowledged and held.
Focus: Nourishment, breath, gentleness.

**Worry / Overthinking (Spleen energy)**
Your mind is trying to create safety by controlling.
Focus: Grounding, rhythm, body trust.

**Fear / Anxiety (Kidney energy)**
Your system doesn't feel safe yet.
Focus: Reassurance, slow rebuilding, consistency.

### KEY PRINCIPLES

- Your body holds emotions. Depression, anxiety, anger — they're not just in your head. They live in your tissues.
- Healing isn't about forcing. It's about creating the conditions for your body to do what it already knows how to do.
- Stagnation doesn't clear by thinking. It clears by movement with awareness.
- If you don't rebuild your energy intentionally, your body will eventually force rest in ways you didn't choose.
- The mind follows the body. Calm the body first.
- Consistency beats intensity. Five minutes daily beats one hour weekly.

## CONTENT TEMPLATES

### EXTERNAL POSTS (For other groups - subtle attraction)

**Type 1: Wisdom Drop**
Share an insight without any CTA. Just value. Let people come to you.

Example:
"Most people try to calm their mind by thinking differently.

But the mind follows the body.

If your body is holding tension, fear, or grief — no amount of positive thinking will quiet your mind.

Calm the body first. The mind will follow."

**Type 2: Pattern Interrupt**
Challenge a common belief gently.

Example:
"Rest doesn't always help.

If you're stagnated — energy stuck, not depleted — more rest can actually make you feel worse.

Sometimes what looks like exhaustion is actually blocked energy that needs to move.

The question isn't always 'how can I rest more?' Sometimes it's 'what am I holding that needs to release?'"

**Type 3: Subtle Story**
Share a piece of your journey that resonates with the group's topic.

Example:
"When I lost my daughter, I didn't cry for years.

I just went numb. Felt almost nothing except occasional anger.

It wasn't until I learned that grief lives in the body — not just the mind — that I finally started to heal.

The sadness was still there. It was just frozen. Once I learned how to let my body release it, everything changed."

**Type 4: Simple Teaching**
One concept, explained simply.

Example:
"In Chinese medicine, we don't ask 'what's wrong with you?'

We ask 'where is the energy stuck?'

Because when energy flows, symptoms tend to resolve on their own.

The body knows how to heal. Our job is to stop blocking it."

### INTERNAL POSTS (For your own community - engagement)

**Type 1: Check-In Question**
Example:
"Quick body check:

Right now, without changing anything — where do you feel tension?

Chest? Belly? Shoulders? Jaw?

Just notice. Don't try to fix it yet.

Drop your answer below. Sometimes just naming it starts the release."

**Type 2: Micro Practice**
Example:
"30-second reset for when your mind won't stop:

1. Place both hands on your belly
2. Breathe into your hands (not your chest)
3. On the exhale, let your shoulders drop
4. Repeat 3 times

That's it. The body just needs a signal that it's safe to slow down.

Try it now and tell me what you notice."

**Type 3: Myth Buster**
Example:
"'I can't meditate — my mind is too busy.'

I hear this constantly. Here's the truth:

Meditation isn't about stopping thoughts. It's about changing your relationship with them.

And honestly? If your body is full of tension, sitting still will just make you more aware of the chaos.

Sometimes movement IS your meditation. Qigong. Walking. Even shaking.

Calm the body first. The mind will follow.

Who else has struggled with 'traditional' meditation?"

**Type 4: Transformation Seed**
Example:
"Something I wish I knew 30 years ago:

You can't think your way out of a feeling that lives in your body.

I spent years trying to 'fix' my depression with my mind. Read every book. Tried every technique.

Nothing worked until I learned to work WITH my body instead of trying to override it.

If you're exhausted from trying to think your way to feeling better... maybe it's time to try a different approach.

What's one thing your body has been trying to tell you that you've been ignoring?"

**Type 5: Win Celebration**
Example:
"Love hearing these moments...

A student messaged me yesterday: 'I did the 5-minute morning Qigong routine every day this week. Nothing dramatic happened, but I noticed I'm not snapping at my kids in the morning anymore.'

That's how it works. Not fireworks. Just... less friction. More ease.

The small shifts are the real shifts.

What small shift have you noticed lately?"
